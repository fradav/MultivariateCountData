# Introduction

Multivariate count data is ubiquitous in statistical applications, as ecology [@Chiquet2021], genomics [@Rau2015; @Silva2019]. These data arise when each observation consists of a vector of count values.
Count data are often treated as continuous data and therefore modeled by a
Gaussian distribution, this assumption is particularly poor when the
measured counts are low. Instead, we use the reference
distribution for count data which is the Poisson distribution
[@Agresti_2002; @Inouye1998].

When a data set is heterogeneous, clustering allows to extract
homogeneous subsets from the whole data set. Many clustering methods,
such as $k$-means [@Hartigan_1979], are geometric in nature, whereas many modern clustering approaches are based
on probabilistic models. In this work, we use model-based clustering which has been developed for many types of data [@Bouveyron_2019; @McLachlanPeel2000; @Fruhwirth_2018].

Modern data are often high-dimensional, that is the number of variables is
often large. Among these variables, some are useful for the task of
interest, some are useless for the task of interest and some others are useful but redundant.
There is a need to select only the relevant variables, and that
whatever is the task. Variable selection methods are widespread for supervised learning tasks, in particular to avoid overfitting. However, variable selection methods are less well developed for unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering. Recently, several
methods have been proposed for selecting the relevant variables in
model-based clustering; we refer to @Fop_2018 and @McParlandMurphy2018 for recent detailed surveys.

The goal of the present work is to provide a clustering and variable selection method
for multivariate count data, which, to the best of our knowledge, has
not yet been studied in depth. A methodology based on a conditionally independent Poisson mixture is developed to achieve this goal. The method yields a final clustering model which is a conditionally independent Poisson mixture model for a subset of the variables.

# Motivating Example

The International Association of Ultrarunners (IAU) 24 hour World
Championships were held in Katowice, Poland from September 8th to 9th,
2012. Two hundred and sixty athletes representing twenty four countries
entered the race, which was held on a course consisting of a 1.554 km
looped route. An update of the number of laps covered by each athlete
was recorded approximately every hour [@WhiteMurphy2016]. @fig-24H plots the number of
loops recorded each hour for the three medalists.

```{r medalists}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| label: fig-24H
#| fig-cap: "Number of loops per hour for the three medalists."
load("X24H.Rdata")
tmp <- sort(as.vector(rowSums(x)), decreasing = TRUE, index.return = TRUE)
matplot(t(matrix(1:24, 3, 24,byrow = TRUE)), t(x[tmp$ix[1:3], 1:24]),type = "o",lty = 3,xlab = 'Hours', ylab = "Number of loops", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", pch = 1:3)
axis(1, at = seq(6, 24, 6),labels = seq(6, 24, 6))
axis(2, at = 6:9, labels = 6:9)
legend("topright", 1:3, col = 1:3, legend=c("Gold medal", "Silver medal", "Bronze medal"), pch = 1:3, cex = 0.8)
```

We can see among these three runners different strategies, the second placed
runner lapped at a regular rate, the first placed runner had a fast start but slowed later, and the third
placed runner also started fast but slowed more than the first place runner.

Our first goal will be, to analyze the whole data set to identify the different running strategies and to
evaluate which strategies are the best ones. The second goal is to identify which
variables allows to distinguish between the clusters, in order to identify which
hour is essential in the management of this endurance race.

# Independent Poisson Mixture

Let $X_n=(X_{n1}, X_{n2}, \ldots, X_{nM})$ be a random vector of counts
for $n=1, 2, \ldots, N$. The goal is to clusters theses $N$ observations
into $G$ clusters. Let $Z_n=(Z_{n1}, Z_{n2}, \ldots, Z_{nG})$ be the
latent cluster indicator vector, where $Z_{ng}=1$ if observation $n$
belongs to cluster $g$ and $Z_{ng}=0$ otherwise. We assume that
${\mathbb P}\{Z_{ng}=1\} = \tau_g$ for $g=1,2, \ldots, G$. Let denote
$\tau=(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_G)$. The conditionally independent Poisson mixture model [@Karlis2018, Section 9.4.2.1]
assumes that the elements of $X_n$ are independent Poisson distributed
random variables, conditional on $Z_n$. That is, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
Z_n & \sim  {\rm Multinomial}(1, \tau)\\
X_{nm}|(Z_{ng}=1) & \sim  {\rm Poisson}(\lambda_{gm}), {\rm ~for~} m=1, 2, \ldots, M.
\end{aligned}
$$
Alternative modelling frameworks exist, either to introduce
some dependence between variables or to normalize the variables. We
refer the interested reader to [@Karlis2018; @Bouveyron_2019, Chapter 6] for more details.

Denoting the model parameters by $\theta=(\tau,\lambda)$ where
$\lambda=(\lambda_{gm})_{1\leq g \leq G, 1\leq m \leq M}$, and where
$X=(x_n)_{1\leq n \leq N}$ denotes the observations, the observed
likelihood is 
$$
L(\theta)=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{g=1}^{G}\tau_g\prod_{m=1}^M\phi(x_{nm},\lambda_{gm}),
$$ 
where $\phi(x,\lambda)=\exp(-\lambda)\lambda^{x}/x!$, the Poisson probability mass function.

Due to form of the mixture distribution, there are no closed form for the maximum
likelihood estimators, and an iterative EM algorithm needs to be used
[@Dempster_1977] to maximize the likelihood. The EM algorithm consists, starts from an initial
value $\theta^{(0)}$ for the model parameter, and alternates the two
following steps until convergence of the likelihood.

At the $q$th iteration of the EM algorithm, the E-step consists of
computing for all $1\leq n\leq N$ and $1\leq g\leq G$:
$$t_{ng}^{(q)}=\frac{\tau_g^{(q)}\prod_{m=1}^M\phi(x_{nm},\lambda_{gm})}{\sum_{h=1}^{G}\tau_h^{(q)}\prod_{m=1}^M\phi(x_{nm},\lambda_{hm})}.$$
In the M-step, the model parameters are updated as follows:
$$ \tau_g^{(q+1)}=\frac{\sum_{n=1}^Nt_{ng}^{(q)}}{N}
\quad {\rm ~and~} \quad
\lambda_{gm}^{(q+1)}=\frac{\sum_{n=1}^Nt_{ng}^{(q)}x_{nm}}{\sum_{n=1}^Nt_{ng}^{(q)}}.
$$
The EM algorithm steps are iterated until convergence, where convergence is determined when $\log L(\theta^{(q+1)}) - \log L(\theta^{(q)}) < \epsilon$.

The number of clusters $G$ is selected using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
[@Schwarz_1978],
$$
BIC= 2 \log L(\hat\theta) - \{(G - 1) + GM\}\log(N),
$$
where $\hat\theta$ is the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters; models with higher BIC are prefered to models with lower BIC.

# Variable selection

We develop a model-based clustering method with variable selection for
multivariate count data. The method follows the approach of [@RafteryDean2006;
@MaugisEtAl2009] for continuous data and [@DeanRaftery2010; @Fop_2017]
for categorical data. It consists in a stepwise model comparison
approach where variables are added and removed from a set of clustering
variables. 

## Model setup

The clustering and variable selection approach is based around partitioning
${X}_n=(X_n^{C}, X_n^{P}, X_n^{O})$ into three parts:

-   $X_n^{C}$: The current clustering variables,
-   $X_n^{P}$: The proposed variable to add to the clustering variables,
-   $X_n^{O}$: The other variables.

For simplicity of notation, $C$ will be used to denote the set of indices of the current clustering variables, $P$ the indices of the proposed variable and $O$ the indices of the other one. Then $(C,P,O)$ is a partition of $\{1,\ldots,M\}$.

The decision on whether to add the proposed variable to the clustering
variables is based on comparing two models:

${\cal M}_1$ (Clustering Model), which assumes that the proposed
variable is useful for clustering: 
$$
(X_n^C, X_n^P) \sim \sum_{g=1}^{G} \tau_g \prod_{m\in\{C, P\}} {\rm Poisson}(\lambda_{gm}).
$$
The ${\cal M}_1$ model is fitted for different values of $G$ between $1$ and $G_{max}$ to achieve the best clustering model.

${\cal M}_2$ (Non-Clustering Model) which assumes that the proposed
variable is not useful for clustering, but is potentially linked to the clustering
variables through a Poisson GLM, that is, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
X_n^C &\sim \sum_{g=1}^{G}\tau_g \prod_{m\in C} {\rm Poisson}(\lambda_{gm})\\
X_n^P| (X_n^C=x_n^C, Z_{ng}=1) & \sim  {\rm PoissonGLM}(x_n^{(C)}),
\end{aligned}
$$
where Poisson GLM states that
$$
\log {\mathbb E}[X_n^P|X_n^C=x_n^C, Z_{ng}=1] = \alpha + \beta^\top x_n^C.
$$

In order to avoid non significant terms in the Poisson GLM
model, a standard stepwise variable selection approach (using BIC as the variable selection criterion) is considered.
Thus, the proposed variable $X_n^P$ will be dependent on
only a subset $X_n^R$ of the clustering variables $X_n^C$.
We note that $G$ is fixed in the non-clustering model, because an optimal value for $G$ is previously chosen. 

The clustering and non-clustering models are represented as graphical
models in @fig-graphical.

:::

Thus, there is two reasons for which ${\cal M}_2$ can be preferred to
${\cal M}_1$: either $X_n^P$ does not contain information about the
latent clustering variable at all (ie. $X_n^R=\emptyset$), or $X_n^P$ does not add
further useful information about the clustering given the information
already contained in the current clustering variables. In the first situation, we say that $X_n^P$ is an irrelevant variable, because it contains no clustering information. In the second
situation, we say that $X_n^P$ is a redundant variable because it contains no extra information about the clustering beyond the current clustering variables ($X_n^C$). 

Additionally, both models assume the same form for the conditional
distribution for $X_n^{O}|(X_{n}^{C}, X_{n}^{P})$ and whose form doesn't
need to be explicitly specified because it doesn't affect the model
choice.

Variable $P$ is added to $C$ if the clustering model (${\cal M}_1$) is
preferred to the non-clustering model (${\cal M}_2$). In order to
compare ${\cal M}_1$ and ${\cal M}_2$, following [@DeanRaftery2010], we
consider the Bayes Factor:
$$B_{1,2}=\frac{p(X|{\cal M}_1)}{p(X|{\cal M}_2)}$$ which is
asymptotically approximated [@Fop_2017; @Kass_1995] using the 
difference of the BIC criteria for both models:
$$2\log B_{1,2}\simeq BIC_{{\cal M}_1}-BIC_{{\cal M}_2}.$$

The same modelling framework can be used for removing variables from the
current set of clustering variables.

## Interpretation {#sec-interpretation}

Comparing ${\cal M}_1$ and ${\cal M}_2$ is equivalent to comparing the
following $X_n^P|(X_n^C=x_n^C)$ structures.

The ${\cal M}_1$ (Clustering Model) assumes that,
$$
X_n^P| (X_n^C=x_n^C) \sim \sum_{g=1}^{G} {\mathbb P}\{Z_{ng}=1|X_{n}^{C}=x_{n}^{C}\} {\rm Poisson}(\lambda_{gm}),
$$
where
$$
{\mathbb P}\{Z_{ng}=1|X_{n}^{C}=x_{n}^{C}\} = \frac{\tau_g \prod_{m=1}^{M}\phi(x_{nm}, \lambda_{gm})}{\sum_{h=1}^{G}\tau_h \prod_{m=1}^{M}\phi(x_{nm}, \lambda_{hm})}.
$$

Whereas, the ${\cal M}_2$ (Non-Clustering Model) assumes that,
$$
X_n^P| (X_n^C=x_n^C) =  {\rm PoissonGLM}(x_n^C).
$$

The method contrasts which of conditional model structures is better
describing the distribution of the proposed variable $X^P$. The
clustering model (${\cal M}_1$) uses a mixture model, with covariate
dependent weights, for the conditional model whereas the non-clustering
model (${\cal M}_2$) is a Poisson generalized linear model. The model
selection criterion chooses the model that best models this conditional
distribution.

## Stepwise selection algorithm

### Screening variables: Initialization

We start with an initial choice of $C$ by first screening each
individual variable by fitting a mixture of univariate Poisson distributions [eg. @EverittHand1981, Chapter 4.3],
$$
X_{nm} \sim \sum_{g=1}^{G}\tau_g {\rm Poisson}(\lambda_{gm}), {\rm ~for~} G=1,2,\ldots, G_{max}.
$$
The initial set of variables is set to be those variables where any
model with $G>1$ is preferred to the $G=1$ model.

### Stepwise algorithm: Updating

We consider a stepwise algorithm which alternates between
adding and removing steps. In the removal step, all the variables in
$X^C$ are examined in turn to be removed from the set. In the adding
step, all the variables in $X^O$ are examined in turn to be added to the
clustering set.

The algorithm also performs the selection of the number $G$ of clusters
finding at each stage the optimal combination of clustering variables
and number of clusters. The procedure stops when no change has been made
to the set $X^C$ after consecutive exclusion and inclusion steps.

With the present stepwise selection algorithm, it can occur that
during the process, we get back on a solution (a set of clustering
variable) already explored. Since our algorithm is not stochastic, we
fall into an infinite cycle. In this situation the algorithm is stopped,
and the best solution according to BIC among the solution of the cycle
is kept.

# Simulation study

In this section, we evaluate the proposed variable selection method
through three different simulation scenarios. We start with an
illustrative example in which, using a data set simulated according to
the proposed model, we show how to perform the variable selection. 

Then, simulation studies are performed to evaluate the behavior of the
proposed selection method, when the data are simulated according to the
proposed model (Scenario1) and when the model
assumptions are violated. In Scenario2, the link
between $X^R$ and $X^C$ is no longer a Poisson GLM but a more complex model. In Scenario3, the clustering variables are no longer
conditionally independent.

## Illustrative example

```{r simulation1}
# Generate data
set.seed(69007)
N <- 400
G <- 3
P <- 10
tau0 <- c(0.4, 0.3, 0.3)
lambda0 <- matrix(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4), G, 4, byrow = TRUE)
l0 <- sample (1:G, prob = tau0, replace = TRUE, size = N)
Ng <- table(l0)
Z0 <- unmap(l0)

x <- matrix(NA, N, P)
for (g in 1:G)
{
  x[l0==g, 1:4] <- matrix(rpois(4 * Ng[g], lambda0[g, ]), Ng[g], 4, byrow = TRUE)
}
#x[, 1:4] <- x[, 1:4] + rpois(N, 1) 
x[ ,5] <- rpois(N, exp(0.2 * x[, 2]))
x[ ,6] <- rpois(N, exp(x[, 1] * 0.2 - 0.1 * x[, 2]))
x[ ,7] <- rpois(N, exp(0.1 * (x[, 1] + x[, 3] + x[, 4])))
x[ ,8] <- rpois(N, 4)
x[ ,9] <- rpois(N, 2)
x[ ,10] <- rpois(N, 1)
```

In the first simulation setting we consider 10 Poisson random variables.
Variables $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ and $X_4$ are the clustering variables,
distributed according to a mixture of $G=$ `r G` independent Poisson
mixture distributions with mixing proportions `r tau0`. Variables $X_5$,
$X_6$ and $X_7$ are redundant variables, each one generated dependent on
the clustering variables. These three variables are linked to the four
first ones through a Poisson GLM. The last three variables, $X_8$, $X_9$
and $X_{10}$ are irrelevant variables not related to the previous ones.
@tbl-ParamSimul shows the parameter of the Poisson distribution for each variable and each cluster.


```{r tabParamSimul}
#| label: tbl-ParamSimul
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| tbl-cap: "True values of component parameters (Scenario 1)"
lambda <- matrix(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4), G, 4, byrow = TRUE)
lambda=cbind(lambda,c('$\\lambda_{g5}$','$\\lambda_{g5}$','$\\lambda_{g5}$'),c('$\\lambda_{g6}$','$\\lambda_{g6}$','$\\lambda_{g6}$'),c('$\\lambda_{g7}$','$\\lambda_{g7}$','$\\lambda_{g7}$'),c(4,4,4),c(2,2,2),c(1,1,1))
colnames(lambda) <- c(paste("$\\lambda_{g", 1:P, "}$", sep =""))
rownames(lambda) <- paste("$g=", 1:3, "$", sep="")
knitr::kable(lambda)
```
with $\lambda_{g5}=\exp(0.2X_2)$, $\lambda_{g6}=\exp(0.2X_1-0.1X_2)$ and $\lambda_{g7}=\exp(0.1 (X_1+X_3+X_4))$.

Below is the result obtained for one data set of size $N=$ `r N`. The
evaluation criteria is the selected features (true one are $X_1$ to
$X_4$) and the Adjusted Rand Index [@Rand_1971; @HubertArabie1985]
obtained with the selected variables in comparison to those obtained
with the full set of variables and with the true clustering variables.

```{r fullpoisson, cache = TRUE}
Gmax <- 10
fit_all <- poissonmix_all(x, G = 1:Gmax)
```

The independent Poisson mixture model was fitted to the simulated data
with $N=$ `r N` rows and $P=$ `r P` columns. Models with $G=1$ to $G=$
`r Gmax` were fitted using the EM algorithm.

The values of BIC for the independent Poisson mixture model are plotted
in @fig-BIC.

```{r plotBIC}
#| label: fig-BIC
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: "Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for the independent Poisson mixture model."
plot(x = 1:Gmax, y = fit_all$BIC, type = "o", xlab = "G", ylab = "BIC")
```

The model with the highest BIC has $G=$ `r fit_all$bestfit$G` components
and the resulting estimates of $\tau$ and $\lambda$ are given as:

```{r fullpoissonparam}
#| label: tbl-params
#| message: false
#| out-width: "70%"
#| tbl-cap: "Estimates of the mixing proportions and component parameters."
tauhat <- fit_all$bestfit$tau
lambdahat <- fit_all$bestfit$lambda
Ghat <- fit_all$bestfit$G
res <- data.frame(tauhat,lambdahat)
colnames(res) <- c("$\\tau_g$", paste("$\\lambda_{g", 1:P, "}$", sep =""))
rownames(res) <- paste("$g=", 1:Ghat, "$", sep="")
knitr::kable(res, digits = 2)
```

A look at @tbl-ParamSimul of true values allows us to say that these estimates are correct (except for label switching).

Let start by initializing the stepwise algorithm.

```{r screening, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
fit_screen <- poissonmix_screen(x, G = 1:Gmax)
jchosen <- fit_screen$jchosen
```

The variables selected by the screening procedure are
{`r fit_screen$jchosen`}.

Now, we execute the stepwise selection algorithm:

```{r varsel, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
fit <- poissonmix_varsel(x, jchosen=jchosen, G = 1:Gmax)
```
Note that the computing time is about 5 minutes on a laptop with 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 32Go of RAM.

The final chosen variables are {`r fit$jchosen`}.

```{r comparison, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
fit_sel <- poissonmix_all(x[,fit$jchosen], G = Ghat)
fit_true <- poissonmix_all(x[,1:4], G = Ghat)
```

Finally, the ARI obtained with the selected variables, which turn out to
be the true clustering variable, is
`r round(adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_sel$bestfit$classification), 3)`
whereas it is
`r round(adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_all$bestfit$classification), 3)` with
all the variables.

## Scenarios of simulation {#sec-Scenari}
In this section the three scenario of simulation are described.
The first scenario is similar to the previous illustrative example.

```{r simulationsize, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
D <- 100
```

```{r simulation1whole, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
selected_variables <- matrix(0, D, P)
ARI <- matrix(NA, D, 3)
colnames(ARI) <- c("Selected variables", "All variables", "True variables")
# register previous results
selected_variables[1, fit$jchosen] <- 1
ARI[1, 1] <- adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_sel$bestfit$classification)
ARI[1, 2] <- adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_all$bestfit$classification)
ARI[1, 3] <- adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_true$bestfit$classification)
# loop on the data sets
for (d in 2:D){
# Generate data
l0 <- sample (1:G, prob=tau0, replace = TRUE, size = N)
Ng <- table(l0)
Z0 <- unmap(l0)
x <- matrix(NA, N, P)
for (g in 1:G)
{
  x[l0==g, 1:4] <- matrix(rpois(4 * Ng[g], lambda0[g, ]), Ng[g], 4, byrow = TRUE)
}
x[ ,5] <- rpois(N, exp(0.2 * x[, 2]))
x[ ,6] <- rpois(N, exp(x[, 1] * 0.2 - 0.1 * x[, 2]))
x[ ,7] <- rpois(N, exp(0.1 * (x[, 1] + x[, 3] + x[, 4])))
x[ ,8] <- rpois(N, 4)
x[ ,9] <- rpois(N, 2)
x[ ,10] <- rpois(N, 1)
# Select G
fit_all <- poissonmix_all(x, G = 1:Gmax)
Ghat <- fit_all$bestfit$G
# Select initial variable
fit_screen <- poissonmix_screen(x, G = 1:Gmax)
jchosen <- fit_screen$jchosen
# Variable selection
fit <- poissonmix_varsel(x, jchosen=jchosen, G = 1:Gmax)
selected_variables[d,fit$jchosen] <- 1
# Computing partitions and ARI
fit_sel <- poissonmix_all(x[,fit$jchosen], G = Ghat)
fit_true <- poissonmix_all(x[,1:4], G = Ghat)
ARI[d, 1] <- adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_sel$bestfit$classification)
ARI[d, 2] <- adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_all$bestfit$classification)
ARI[d, 3] <- adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_true$bestfit$classification)
}
```

```{r loadsim1, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
load('result-simulation1.Rdata')
ARI1=ARI
selected_variables1=selected_variables
```

The second scenario is similar to the first one, except for variables
$X_5$, $X_6$ and $X_7$ which are still redundant but linked to the true
clustering variables through linear, quadratic and exponential term in an identity link function, respectively, and not a Poisson GLM with logarithm link function. More precisely, $X_5$, $X_6$ and $X_7$ have Poisson distribution of respective parameter $\lambda_{g5}=\exp(2X_2)$, $\lambda_{g6}=\exp(X_1^2+X_3)$ and $\lambda_{g7}=\exp(\exp(0.1 (X_1 + X_3+ X_4)))$.
Thus, the data are simulated from a model which
does not satisfy assumptions of model ${\cal M}_2$.

```{r simulation2whole, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
selected_variables <- matrix(0, D, P)
ARI <- matrix(NA, D, 3)
colnames(ARI) <- c("Selected variables", "All variables", "True variables")
# loop on the data sets
for (d in 1:D){
# Generate data
l0 <- sample (1:G, prob=tau0, replace = TRUE, size = N)

x <- matrix(NA, N, P)
for (g in 1:G)
{
  x[l0==g, 1:4] <- matrix(rpois(4 * Ng[g], lambda0[g, ]), Ng[g], 4, byrow = TRUE)
}
x[ ,5] <- rpois(N, 2 * x[, 2])
x[ ,6] <- rpois(N, x[, 1] ^ 2 + x[, 3])
x[ ,7] <- rpois(N, exp(0.1 * (x[, 1] + x[, 3] + x[, 4])))
x[ ,8] <- rpois(N, 4)
x[ ,9] <- rpois(N, 2)
x[ ,10] <- rpois(N, 1)
# Select G
fit_all <- poissonmix_all(x, G = 1:Gmax)
Ghat <- fit_all$bestfit$G
# Select initial variable
fit_screen <- poissonmix_screen(x, G = 1:Gmax) 
jchosen <- fit_screen$jchosen
# Variable selection
fit <- poissonmix_varsel(x, jchosen=jchosen, G = 1:Gmax)
selected_variables[d,fit$jchosen]=1
# Computing partitions and ARI
fit_sel <- poissonmix_all(x[,fit$jchosen], G = Ghat)
fit_true <- poissonmix_all(x[,1:4], G = Ghat)
ARI[d, 1] <- adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_sel$bestfit$classification)
ARI[d, 2] <- adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_all$bestfit$classification)
ARI[d, 3] <- adjustedRandIndex(l0, fit_true$bestfit$classification)
}
```

```{r loadsim2, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

The third scenario is similar to the second one, but some dependence
between the clustering variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ is introduced, in order
to create some redundancy among the true clustering variables. For this, $X_1$ and $X_2$ are simulated as in the previous setting, and a same term is added to both of these variables (simulated according a Poisson distribution of parameter 2) .

## Results {#sec-wholeresults}

@tbl-HISTall shows the number of times, among the `r D` simulated
data sets, that each variable is selected. 
For Scenario 1, the model selection procedure perform perfectly, selecting each time only the true clustering
variables. For Scenario 2, due to the fact the link between the redundant and the true clustering
variables is not a standard Poisson GLM, the variable selection is perturbed and
variables $X_5$ is sometimes selected. For Scenario 3, the results is that the dependency between $X_1$ and $X_2$ perturb the variable selection, and only one of them is selected (and even sometimes
none of them). Redundant variables $X_5$ and $X_6$, which are linked to the clustering variables but with a linear link, are also sometimes selected. 
```{r tabHISTall}
#| label: tbl-HISTall
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| tbl-cap: "Number of selection for each variable, simulation setting number 3."
res <- matrix(c(colSums(selected_variables1),colSums(selected_variables2),colSums(selected_variables3)),3,P,byrow = TRUE)
colnames(res) <- paste("$X_{", 1:P, "}$", sep ="")
rownames(res) <- c("Scenario 1","Scenario 2","Scenario 3")
knitr::kable(res)
```

@fig-all3 plots the distribution of the ARI differences between the model with either the selected variables or all the variables, and the one with the true clustering variables. These plots shows that for all scenarios, the ARI of the model with the selected variables (left boxplot of each plot) are always closest to the optimal ARI (obtained with the true clustering variables).
```{r plotall3}
#| label: fig-all3
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of the ARI differences with the model with the true clustering variables, for the model with the selected variables and the model with all variables."
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
par(mar = c(6, 2, 2, 2))
ARI=matrix(c(ARI1[,1]-ARI1[,3],ARI1[,2]-ARI1[,3]),ncol=2,byrow=FALSE)
colnames(ARI)<-c("Selected var. - True var.","All var. - True var.")
boxplot(ARI, cex.axis=0.7,ylim=c(-.5,.2),las = 2,main='Scenario 1',xlab='');abline(h=0,col=2,las = 2)
ARI=matrix(c(ARI2[,1]-ARI2[,3],ARI2[,2]-ARI2[,3]),ncol=2,byrow=FALSE)
colnames(ARI)<-c("Selected var. - True var.","All var. - True var.")
boxplot(ARI, cex.axis=0.7,ylim=c(-.5,.2),las = 2,main='Scenario 21',xlab='');abline(h=0,col=2,las = 2)
ARI=matrix(c(ARI3[,1]-ARI3[,3],ARI3[,2]-ARI3[,3]),ncol=2,byrow=FALSE)
colnames(ARI)<-c("Selected var. - True var.","All var. - True var.")
boxplot(ARI, cex.axis=0.7,ylim=c(-.5,.2),las = 2,main='Scenario 3',xlab='');abline(h=0,col=2,las = 2)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

Finally @fig-all2 plots the histogram of the difference of ARI with the selected variables and with all the variables.
This plot illustrates the interest of variable selection on the clustering results, and indeed, for all the scenarios, the ARI is better with the selected variables than when using all the variables. 
```{r plotall2}
#| label: fig-all2
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of the ARI differences for the model with the selected variables and the model with all variables."
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
par(mar = c(6, 2, 2, 2))
hist(ARI1[, 1] - ARI1[, 2], xlab = 'ARI differences',main='Scenario 1',xlim=c(-.1,.5))
abline(v=0,col=2)
hist(ARI2[, 1] - ARI2[, 2], xlab = 'ARI differences',main='Scenario 2',xlim=c(-.1,.5))
abline(v=0,col=2)

# International Ultrarunning Association Data

```{r loadrunning, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
load("X24H.Rdata")
P <- ncol(x)
Gmax <- 10
```

We apply the proposed procedure to the data from the 2012 International Ultrarunning Association World 24H Championships. 

We start by initializing the stepwise algorithm, and find the
variables selected by the screening procedure:

```{r screenrunning, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
fit_screen <- poissonmix_screen(x, G = 1:Gmax)
jchosen <- fit_screen$jchosen
jchosen
```

We then execute the proposed stepwise selection algorithm (the computing time is about 26 minutes on a laptop with 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 32Go of RAM):

```{r fitrunning, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fit <- poissonmix_varsel(x, jchosen = jchosen, G = 1:Gmax)
```

```{r loadfitrunning, echo = FALSE}
load("RunningFit.Rdata")
```

The final chosen variables found by the algorithm are:

```{r runningchosen, echo = FALSE}
fit$jchosen
```

The optimal number of clusters `r fit$bestfit$G` has been chosen inside the stepwise selection algorithm. The same choice is obtained when looking for the best $G$ with the conditionally independent Poisson mixture on the selected variables (@fig-BIC2).

```{r plotBIC2}
#| label: fig-BIC2
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: "Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for the independent Poisson mixture model with the seleceted variables."
Gmax <- 10
fit_all <- poissonmix_all(as.matrix(x[,fit$jchosen]), G = 1:Gmax)
plot(x = 1:Gmax, y = fit_all$BIC, type = "o", xlab = "G", ylab = "BIC")
```

In order to illustrate the results, we plot the cluster means according
to the `r P` variable mean parameters per cluster. For each variable not
in the chosen variable set, a Poisson regression model is fitted with
the chosen variables as predictors. Forward and backwards variable
selection is conducted on this regression, if the regression model has any
predictor variables, then the variable is called "redundant" and if the
regression model has no predictor variables, then the variable is called
"irrelevant".
@fig-Running-result1 shows the cluster mean for each variable, where the
label indicates if the variable is irrelevant for clustering ("I"),
redundant ("R") or useful (the label is then the cluster number).

```{r plotrunning, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE}
#| label: fig-Running-result1
#| fig-cap: "Cluster means and usefulness of the variables."
matplot(fit$jchosen, t(fit$bestfit$lambda), xlab = 'Hours', ylab = "Number of laps", xaxt = "n",yaxt = "n", xlim = c(1, P), ylim = range(x[,-16]))
axis(1, at = seq(6, 24, 6),labels = seq(6, 24, 6))
axis(2, at = 0:9, labels = 0:9)
abline(v = fit$jchosen, col = "lightgray", lty = 3)
matplot(fit$jchosen, t(fit$bestfit$lambda), type = "p", add = TRUE)

G <- fit$bestfit$G
Z <- fit$bestfit$Z
x <- as.matrix(x)
xmeans <- t(Z) %*% x / apply(Z, 2, sum)
jremove <- setdiff(1:P, fit$jchosen)

vartype <- rep(NA, P)
vartype[fit$jchosen] <- "Clustering"
for (j in jremove)
{
  y <- x[, j]
  Xregr <- x[, fit$jchosen]
  datregr <- data.frame(y, Xregr)
  fitglm <- glm(y ~ ., family = "poisson", data = datregr)
  fit1 <- glm(y ~ 1, family = "poisson", data = datregr)
  modelscope <- list(lower = formula(fit1), upper = formula(fitglm))
  fitglmb <- step(fit1, scope = modelscope, k = log(N), trace = 0, direction = "forward")
  fitglmf <- step(fitglm, scope = modelscope, k = log(N), trace = 0, direction = "backward")
  if (BIC(fitglmf) < BIC(fitglmb)) {fitglms <- fitglmf} else {fitglms <- fitglmb}
  if (length(coef(fitglms)) > 1)
  {
    vartype[j] <- "Redundant"
    text(rep(j, G), xmeans[, j], rep("R", G), col = 1:G)
  } else {
    vartype[j] <- "Irrelevant"
    text(rep(j, G), xmeans[, j], rep("I", G), col = 1:G)
    
  }
}
matplot(1:P, t(xmeans), col = 1:G, type = "c", lty = 1, add = TRUE)
```
The variables discriminate the clusters pacing strategies of
the runners are the number of laps covered during the last two thirds of
the race (except during the 13th and 23rd hours). The number of laps
covered during the first eight hours does not provide any additional
clustering information, and even no information at all for the number of laps covered during the first hour.

@fig-Running-result3 plots the density map per clusters. Area of high density (red) indicates the hours and the corresponding average number of laps specific of each cluster.

```{r ARIrunning, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
#| label: fig-Running-result3
#| fig-cap: "Density maps per cluster"
ylim <- range(x)
xlim <- c(1, P)
xvec <- 1:P
yvec <- min(x):max(x)
xygrid <- expand.grid(xvec, yvec)

par(mfrow = c(3, 2))
par(mar = c(2.5, 3, 1.5, 1))
par(mgp = c(1.3, .4, 0))
for (g in 1:fit$bestfit$G)
{
  zmat <- matrix(NA, P, length(yvec))
  Pchosen <- length(fit$jchosen)
  for (p in 1:Pchosen)
  {
    zmat[fit$jchosen[p], ] <- dpois(yvec, fit$bestfit$lambda[g, p])
  }
  rownames(zmat) <- 1:P
  colnames(zmat) <- yvec
  image(xvec, yvec, zmat, xlab = "Hour", ylab = "Laps", main = paste("Cluster ", g, sep = "", collapse = ""))
  matplot(t(x[fit$bestfit$classification == g, ]), xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim, type = "l", add = TRUE, col = "lightgray", lty = 1)
}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

Cluster 5  are clearly the most efficient runners. Looking at the running
strategy in @fig-Running-result1 and @fig-Running-result3, we can see that they start as runners
of Cluster 1 and Cluster 2, but they managed to keep a constant pace on
the second part of the race, unlike those of the other two clusters
which faltered. Runners of Cluster 3 has covered the fewest number of
laps. Indeed, looking at their running strategy, we can see that most of these runners stop after the first third of
the race. Cluster 6 is relatively similar to Cluster 3, but runners
manage to continue running until half of the race is completed. Finally, Cluster 4 obtains
slightly better results than Cluster 6, starting more carefully, and
managing to run until the end of the race, even if the pace of the last
hours is not very constant.

Finally, @fig-Running-result2 shows boxplots of the total number of loops covered by the runners in each of the clusters.

```{r ARIrunning, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
#| label: fig-Running-result2
#| fig-cap: "Number of loops covered by the runners of each clusters."
tmp <- sort(as.vector(rowSums(x)), decreasing = TRUE, index.return = TRUE)
boxplot(rowSums(x) ~ map(Z), xlab = 'Cluster', ylab = 'Total number of laps')
```

# Discussion

A method for clustering and variable selection for multivariate count data has been proposed. The method is shown to give excellent performance on both simulated and real data examples. The method selects set of relevant variables for clustering and other variables are not selected if they are irrelevant or redundate for clustering purposes. 

The proposed method is shown to give interesting insights in the application domain, where some clusters members are shown to perform better overall to others and the benefits of constant (or near constant pacing) are shown. 

The level of variable selection is determined by the relative performance of the two models (as shown in @sec-interpretation) is compared. Alternative models to the Poisson GLM model which have greater flexibility could lead to a smaller set of selected variables than the proposed method achieves. This is a topic for future research. 

The proposed method is based on a conditionally independent Poisson mixture model for the selected variables. It could be argued that the conditional independence assumption is unrealistic in the application. @Hand2001 consider the implication of incorrectly assuming conditional independence in a classification setting and show that it can make the group membership probabilities over confident. Furthermore, in the conditional independent Poisson mixture model, the number of clusters can be upwardly biased, where extra clusters are included to model dependence in the data. The approach taken in the paper could be extended to use other multivariate count distributions, including multivariate distributions without the conditional independence assumption [eg. @Karlis2018; @Karlis_2007; @Inouye_2017].

The code for the proposed approach will be made available as an R package.
